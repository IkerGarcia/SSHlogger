**Synopsis**

This project analyzes auth.log files (both unzipped and zipped) and tracks the login attempts so it is possible to check failed login attempts and successful login attempts. With this information we can decide if the security in our system must be improved.

You **MUST** add your own IP to the different if statements to get proper results.

SSHlogger has been created by Iker Garc√≠a.

**Motivation**

Security improvement. Opening SSH to the world without appropiate barriers is a common issue. With this program everyone can easily know if there is a security hole and try to fix it. It's a easy way to automate the reading of auth.log files.
